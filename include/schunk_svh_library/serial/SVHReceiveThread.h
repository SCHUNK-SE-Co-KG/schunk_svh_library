 * This file contains the ReceiveThread for the serial communication.  In order
 * to receive packages independently from the sending direction, instantiate
 * this class in client code and call its run() method in a separate thread.
 *
 * This class will then poll the serial interface periodically for new data. If
 * data is present, a statemachine will evaluate the right packet structure and
 * send the data via callback to the caller for further parsing once a complete
 * serial packaged is received.
